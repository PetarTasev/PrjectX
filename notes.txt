app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('home', { 
    layout: false})
})

the layout:false makes it so handlebars dont need to to find a template and it can
just render the template we want it to render

in the res.render('home', {layout: false}) the place where you put layout: false is 
the place where you can afterwords add a the context aka you add files under the name
of the original placeholders 

or you can user 

res.locals.message = "Hello there"
making the place holder message in the template you are rendering hold the value of
'Hello there'


*if useranme is of truthy value then on the file will be writen Welcome USERNAME
and if username dosnt exist then {{else}} is executed
   {{#if username}}
   <p> Welcome {{username}}</p>
   {{else}}
   <p> Welcome Guest </p>
   {{/if}}

*if you have array of multiple elements that need to be visualised in a list we need
to use {{#each}} {{/each}} if the element is empty then {{else}} will be executed
   {{#each contact}}
   <li>{{name}}: {{email}}</li>
   {{else}}
   <p> Empty list</p>
   {{/each}}

   contact: [
    {
        name:  Petar
        email: petar@abv.bg
    }
    {
        name:  Ioan
        email: ioan@abv.bg
    }
   ]

   Result: 
   Petar: petar@abv.bg
   Ioan: ioan@abv.bg
   where in each repetition the context becomes the individual element of the array

   Further more
   {{#if contact}}
   {{#each contact}}
   <li>{{name}}: {{email}}</li>
   {{/each}}

   {{else}}
   <p> No contacts </p>
   {{/if}}
   meaning that if contacts is empty then it will say no contacs without the need to
   use {{else}} in the {{each}} function

   in partials you take templated and insert then in your main file using 
   {{>name}} that name being a name of a file in the parital section

   {{{}}} {{}} 
   in the case of 3{} is the equivelent of innerHTML
   in the case of 2{} is the equivelent of textContent
